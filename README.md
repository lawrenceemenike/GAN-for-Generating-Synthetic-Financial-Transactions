# Generative Adversarial Network Model to generate synthetic financial transactions for developing fraud detection systems.

This repository contains a GAN model designed to generate synthetic financial transactions, which can be used for developing and testing fraud detection systems. The goal of this project is to create a realistic dataset that mimics the patterns of actual financial transactions, including both legitimate and fraudulent activities.

## Overview

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a powerful tool for generating synthetic data. This project utilizes a GAN architecture to produce synthetic financial transaction data. The generated data can help in improving the performance of fraud detection algorithms by providing additional training samples, especially in cases where fraudulent transactions are rare.

## Features

- **Generator Network**: A neural network that generates synthetic financial transaction data.
- **Discriminator Network**: A neural network that distinguishes between real and synthetic data.
- **Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP)**: An improved GAN architecture that helps stabilize the training process and produce high-quality synthetic data.
- **Class Imbalance Handling**: Utilizes a weighted random sampler to address class imbalance in the training data.
- **Data Scaling**: Uses MinMaxScaler to normalize the transaction data for better GAN performance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6+
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lawrenceemenike/GAN-for-Generating-Synthetic-Financial-Transactions.git
   cd GAN-for-Generating-Synthetic-Financial-Transactions

2. Install the required packages:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
Prepare your dataset:

Ensure your dataset is in a CSV file with appropriate columns for financial transactions.
The dataset should include features such as amount, step, isFraud, and other relevant transaction details.
Preprocess the data:

Use the provided code to scale and preprocess your data before feeding it to the GAN model.
Train the GAN model:

Run the Jupyter Notebook GAN_to_generate_synthetic_financial_transactions_for_developing_fraud_detection_systems_.ipynb to train the generator and discriminator networks.
Adjust hyperparameters as needed to improve the quality of the generated data.
Generate synthetic data:

After training, use the generator to produce synthetic financial transactions.
Save and analyze the synthetic data for use in fraud detection system development.
Example
Below is an example of how to load and preprocess your data, train the GAN model, and generate synthetic transactions:
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
import torch
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset, WeightedRandomSampler

# Load your dataset
df = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

# Preprocess the data
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
df_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(df.drop(['isFraud', 'isFlaggedFraud'], axis=1).values)
dataset = TensorDataset(torch.tensor(df_scaled, dtype=torch.float32))

# Train the GAN model
# (Refer to the Jupyter Notebook for detailed training steps)

# Generate synthetic data
num_samples = 1000
synthetic_samples = generate_synthetic_samples(generator, num_samples, input_dim, device)

# Save synthetic data to CSV
synthetic_df = pd.DataFrame(synthetic_samples, columns=df.drop(['isFraud', 'isFlaggedFraud'], axis=1).columns)
synthetic_df.to_csv('synthetic_transactions.csv', index=False)


## Results
The synthetic data generated by the GAN model should exhibit similar statistical properties to the real transaction data.
Visualizations and statistical comparisons can be used to evaluate the quality of the synthetic data.
